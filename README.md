MailTel

Tired of having to check your email to see what will arrive in your mailbox in 3-8 hours?  Improve the pipeline from postal mail to your brain box.  Here's how we automate the experience of looking at your mail to oblivion...

First, sign up for USPS's free Informed Delivery service using your gmail account. The script will work once you are receiving emails.

Then, follow Step 1 on the [python quickstart guide for Gmail API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python). Remember to save credentials.json to this directory.

Next, install the required files...
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Also, edit config.py with your telegram bot token and the chat id you want to use.

Choose your favorite way to automate the script execution (e.g. cron).

Finally, do nothing but stare at your cellphone while the mail comes to you! 

At last, leaving the house to walk to your mailbox is no longer a necessity. Modern life!
